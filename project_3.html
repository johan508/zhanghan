			I donâ€™t have an accurate number to prove but based on my past experiences, online marketing nowadays seems more economical and efficient than conventional marketing schemes, 
			such as TV commercials. Imagine if I have a website (I do have one) or an online store, with the help of digital (web traffic) analytics I can answer three questions in no time: <br><br>
			1. Who are my visitors (and how many)? (Acquisition) <br>
			2. What do they do on my website (and how many)? (Behaviour) <br>
			3. Who became my customers eventually (and the ratio)? (Conversion)<br>
