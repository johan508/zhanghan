				<li><b>A retro user profile management app </b></li>
				     <br>
				This was a project when I was teaching batch file programing in the course - Older operating systems, in CDE college in 2021 .... <br>
				<br>
				<b>This is a retro user profile management app first existed in the end of 19th century! It was developed by Han Zhang in 1895.01.01. It will help you to manage the user profile - create, delete, search, modify. Suppose your company's name is JMS, you can change any name as you like. Put this .bat file into your D drive. Otherwise you'll need to change the path. When you first open up the batch file, a directory with your company's name will be created automatically, with 4 departments' folders - IT, HR, etc. (you can create more by yourself). Then create a user's profile by inputting relative info (name, age, department), 
				a text file will be created saved in the relative direcotory of his/her department. It is on sale now for just 5 dollars!!!</b>
