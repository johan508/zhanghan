				<li><b>A retro app of user profile management</b></li>
				     <br>
				This was one of the projects that I made when I was teaching batch file programing in the course - Older operating systems, in CDE college in 2021 .... <br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<i>This is a retro user profile management app first existed in the end of 19th century! It was developed by Han Zhang in 1895.02.31. Suppose you own a small company - JMS (you can change any name as you like). 
				   This little app will help you to manage the employee's profile (create, delete, search) in your computer's file system efficiently...  
				   When you first open up the batch file, a directory with your company's name will be created automatically, with 5 departments' folders - Developing, IT, HR, etc. (you can create more by yourself).
				   Before opening, put this .bat file into your D drive, otherwise you'll need to change the path.  You can create a user's profile by inputting relative info (name, age, phone no., department), 
				   a text file will be created and saved in the relative directory of his/her department. You might ask why we don't do that by mouse directly? Because there was no Graphical User Interface in 19th century! :)</i><br>
				<br>
				This is how it looks like: <br><br>
				<img src="/img/user_profile_1.png" alt="user profile app" width="800" height="400" class="responsive-logo">
				<br>
				This is your input: <br><br>
				<img src="/img/user_profile_3.png" alt="user profile app" width="800" height="400" class="responsive-logo">
				<br>
				and here are the folders created automatically ...<br><br>
				<img src="/img/user_profile_2.png" alt="user profile app" width="800" height="400" class="responsive-logo">
				<br>
				this is the created user's profile: <br><br>
