			<p>	 Hi there! Welcome to my website. My name is Han Zhang. I’m a data enthusiast and a nerd. I earned my Master's degree of Computer Science in 2020 from Bishop's University. The fields I’m interested in including (but not limited to) data model developing & analysis, data engineering, business intelligence and machine learning. I have 4+ years of experiences in data analysis (3y in education, 1+ y in e-commerce and sales).

				Je suis originaire de Chine et je suis arrivé au Québec, Canada en 2017 - pour faire mes études en informatique à Bishop's University. Mais avant mon arrivée, j'avais rarement parlé français (ben oui, j'ai appris un peu de grammaire chez moi dans mon pays). Grâce à Bishop's, j'ai eu de la chance d'accéder au Québec et de suivre des cours de français. Chaque semestre, en plus de mes cours d'informatique 
				je m'inscrivais à un cours de français. Après avoir obtenu mon diplôme à Bishiop's, j'ai continué à l'apprendre, de la télé, des employés chez Tim Hortons, Super C ... des personnes dans la rue, etc., puis en 2021, j'ai réussi à obtenir le niveu B2 dans l'examen du TEFAQ. Mais, mon apprentissage (soit le français, soit l'informatique ou les deux) va jamais s'arrêter ... <br>
				<br>
				I started my work as an Enrolment & Process Data Analyst of the Registrar's Office at Bishop’s University (BU) in Sherbrooke, QC in Feb. 2022. Over the past 3 years at BU, data analysis has been a key part of my routine. I have participated in several academic KPI analysis and reporting projects, including Graduation / Retention analysis, Admission Reports, BCI reporting, etc. 
				In addition, I also helped the other departments to develop some small practical tools, e.x. in the dev. of <b>Excel</b> tool - "Faculty seniority points calculator", I was responsible for creating the model and dynamic user interface in report page, partially by <b>VBA</b>. In 2023, I participated in the project of registrar’s office to optimize the course withdrawn process. During this project, I self-learned the <b>MS Power Automate</b>, and I helped to improve the workflow in it. 
				<br>
				<br>
				From Jul. 2024, I regularly maintain and update a legacy faculty <b>database</b> of Business School and export the data to <b>Power BI</b> to create faculty reports. So, <b>SQL</b>, <b>models</b>, <b>DAX</b>, various visuals, … that’s amazing! I’m living in Power BI right now. 
				<br>
				<br>
				In addition to the projects at my workplace, I’m also conducting my personal ones, for example, the DIY of this website - it was created by myself from scratch in some simple <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b>. In the beginning, it was hosted on my own server in my bedroom and people need to enter my public IP address to visit it. Because I didn't want to keep it on for 24 hours (I can't afford the electric bill),
				two years later I migrated it into <b>GitHub</b>. In the meantime, I registered this domaine name and set up the <b>DNS</b> (people don't need to enter numbers like 142.120.... anymore). Now I keep its main structure, and just make some minor updates from time to time. Even though it's not very good looking, mais je m'en fous. For more information about my other personal projects, <a href="myProject.html">please click here</a>.

			<p>I was a novice computer science teacher at CDE college (now Cestar College) in Sherbrooke, QC, from 2020 to 2021. The courses I have given include: <br /></p>	
			<ul>
				<li>Older Operating System – a general introduction to the vintage OS (Windows XP), the file system, the <b>CMD command line</b>
					to manipulate the file system, and the batch file scripting.</li>
				<br />
				<li>Application Software (MS Office) – a general guide to the basic functionalities and manipulations of the Microsoft Office suites,
					including the MS Word, Access (A demo database will be created and manipulated.), Excel (creation of formulas, pivot tables, basic Macros by VBA).  </li>
				<br />
				<li>Database – It's all about an introduction to the Relational Database Management System - the concepts of RDBMS, ER-Model, the Schemas, Keys, INNER JOIN, OUTER JOIN, etc. And the creation and manipulation
					of a sample database in <b>MySQL</b>.</li>
				<br />
				<li>Programming Utility Software – It's a guide to the programming of basic utility software by Visual Basic, a simple app with UI will be made. This course will lay a solid foundation for those who will work in VBA.</li>
				<br />
				<li>Computer Networking: Access Management & Resource Sharing – This course is an introduction to the computer networking in layered architecture, 
					which includes the <b>OSI model</b>, the <b>TCP/IP model</b>, the protocols of each layer. Furthermore, the basic concepts and features of Server 
					Roles, Domain Controller, Active Directory, Group Policy will also be touched. The Windows Server 2012 R2 will be installed in a virtual environment
					and be palyed around.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>From the summer of 2019 to 2020, I was so lucky that I got my first job in Canada - worked as an IT Service Desk Technician at CGI Inc. in Sherbrooke. My main job was to troubleshoot the issues of hardware (PCs, laptops, tablets, printers,etc.) and 
			   software (more than 50% issues are related to Windows OS and utility software on top of Windows; around 20% issues are about VPN or banking software), and then created the tickets. The main tool we used back then was ServiceNow.
