			<p>	Hi there! Welcome to my website. My name is Han Zhang. I’m a data enthusiast and a nerd. I earned my Master's degree of Computer Science in 2020. The fields I’m interested in including (but not limited to) data model developing & analysis, data engineering and machine learning. I have been working in data analysis fields (sometimes as IT roles) across several sectors for almost 5 years (I worked as similiar roles 
				for some years already before returning back to school). 
				<br>
				<br>
				Since Feb. 2022, I have been working at Bishop’s University (BU) in Sherbrooke, QC. Over the past 3 years at BU, data analysis has been a key part of my routine. I have participated in several academic KPI analysis and reporting projects in Registrar's Office, including Graduation / Retention analysis, Admission Reports, BCI reporting, etc. 
				In 2023, I participated in the project of registrar’s office to optimize the course withdrawn process. During this project, I self-learned the MS Power Automate, and I helped to improve the workflow in it. 
				<br>
				<br>
				From Jul. 2024, I regularly maintain and update a legacy faculty database of Business School and export the data to Power BI to create faculty reports. So, SQL, models, DAX, various visuals, … that’s amazing! I’m living in Power BI right now. 
				<br>
				<br>
				In addition to the projects at my workplace, I’m also conducting my personal ones, for example, this website - it was created by myself from scratch in some simple HTML and CSS. In the beginning, it was hosted on my own server in my bed room, since I didn't want to keep it on for 24 hours (I can't afford the electric bill),
				two years later I migrated it into GitHub. Over the years, I kept the main structure but just made some minor updates from time to time. For more information about my other personal projects, <a href="myProject.html">please click here</a>.

			<p>I was a computer science teacher in CDE college (now Cestar College) in Sherbrooke, QC, in 2021. The courses I have given include: <br /></p>	
			<ul>
				<li>Older Operating System – a general introduction to the vintage OS (Windows XP), the file system, the <b>CMD command line</b>
					to manipulate the file system, and the <b>batch file programming</b>.</li>
				<br />
				<li>Application Software (MS Office) – a general guide to the basic functionalities and manipulations of the <b>Microsoft Office suites</b>,
					including the MS Word, Access (A demo database will be created and manipulated.), Excel (creation of formulas, pivot tables, basic Macros by VBA).  </li>
				<br />
				<li>Database – It's all about an introduction to the Relational Database Management System - the concepts of RDBMS, ER-Model, the Schemas, Keys, INNER JOIN, OUTER JOIN, etc. And the creation and manipulation
					of a sample database in <b>MySQL</b>.</li>
				<br />
				<li>Programming Utility Software – It's a guide to the programming of basic utility software by <b>Visual Basic</b>, a simple app with UI will be made. This course will lay a solid foundation for those who will work in VBA.</li>
				<br />
				<li>Computer Networking: Access Management & Resource Sharing – This course is an introduction to the computer networking in layered architecture, 
					which includes the <b>OSI model</b>, the <b>TCP/IP model</b>, the protocols of each layer. Furthermore, the basic concepts and features of Server 
					<b>Roles, Domain Controller, Active Directory, Group Policy</b> will also be touched. The Windows Server 2012 R2 will be installed in a virtual environment
					and be palyed around.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>From the summer of 2019 to 2020, I worked as an IT Service Desk Technician at CGI Inc. in Sherbrooke. My main job was to troubleshoot the issues of hardware (PCs, laptops, tablets, printers,etc.) and 
			   software (more than 50% issues are related to Windows OS and utility software on top of Windows; around 20% issues are about VPN or banking software), and then created the tickets. The main tool we used back then was ServiceNow.
