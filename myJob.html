			<p>	Hi there! Welcome to my website. My name is Han Zhang. I’m a data enthusiast and a nerd. I hold a Master degree of Computer Science. The fields I’m interested in including (but not limited to) data model developing & analysis (in Power BI), data warehousing and machine learning. <!--I have been working in data analysis fields across various sectors for about 5 years.--> 
				<br>
				<br>
				At present, I’m working at Bishop’s University (BU) in Sherbrooke, QC. Since the past 3 years at BU, data analysis has been kind of my routine. I have participated in several academical data analysis and reporting projects in Registrar's Office, ex., Admission Reports; BCI reporting, etc. 
				In 2023, I participated in the project of registrar’s office to optimize the course withdrawn process. During this project, I self-learned the MS Power Automate, and I helped to improve the workflow in it. 
				<br>
				<br>
				From fall 2024, I regularly maintain and update a legacy faculty database of Business School and export the data to Power BI to create faculty reports. So, SQL, models, DAX, various visuals, … that’s amazing! I’m living in Power BI right now. 
				<br>
				<br>
				In addition to the projects at my workplace, I’m also conducting my personal ones. For more information, <a href="myProject.html">please click here</a>.
