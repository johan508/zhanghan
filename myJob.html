			<p> Hi there! Welcome to my website! My name is Han Zhang. I'm a son, a husband, a father of a little girl and the co-owner of a gold fish; In additon, I'm a co-founder and deputy CEO of Carbon-based Biological Complex Habitats ... my house; I'm also a CLO - chief lighting officer, because I'm in charge of turning on and off the porch light (now I changed smart light bulb though). I'm serious, with these impressive accomplishements, I must give my thanks to my past business experience, co-founding a startup based on an educational institution - to rent CDs in my dorm at the university. Right now, my job is, as my daughter said, playing the computer everyday. Kind of right, I'm a data analyst working in Bishop's University.
				When opening up my website, you might have the feeling like going back to 1998, this is because I didn't use any fancy web template, I just used some photo I took and some basic CSS. Oh, by the way, the server of this website is in my bedroom, so, when you see 404 on your web broswer, maybe I'm sleeping :). But if you happen to be 
				lucky enough to see this website, congrats!  J'apprend français depuis environs 5 ans, alors, de temps en temps, je voudrais écrire quelque chose en français. Merci de me corriger! Ah, oui, ce site web est entrenu par moi-même complètment. Donc, 
la mise à jour du site dépend entièrement de mon humeur. Ben là.... I'm a bit lazy now... my website won't be updated in recent years...
