			<p> Hi, there! My name is Han Zhang. I'm currently a data analyst working in Bishop's University. Furthermore, I'm a son, a busband and a father of a little girl (and the owner of a little gold fish). I'm also a French learner. Alors, de temps en temps, je voudrais écrire quelque chose
				en français aussi afin de l'améliorer. Merci de me corriger!
				Oh, by the way, the server of this website is in my bedroom, so, when you see 404 on your web broswer, maybe I'm sleeping (just kidding). But if you happen to be 
				lucky enough to see this website, congrats!
